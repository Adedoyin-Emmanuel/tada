# Mobile API

This repo contains the codebase for the mobile API. I will be building the backend with **C# and ASP.NET**. Because why not. I love the concept of DI and Dotnet is just so beautiful, I could use Typescript with Express or NestJS but I honestly don't feel like. I haven't written C# in a while, I miss my baby lol. Wetin I dey do. I will also be playing with .NET 9 and **Scalar** as my API docs tool instead of **Swagger** if you're a Dotnet dev, you will know why lol. Well, .NET 9 doesn't come with Swagger, Microsoft removed it because the package wasn't actively maintained. C# and React-Native somebody wake me up, that's a stack I never thought I will use lol.
