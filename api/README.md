# Mobile API

This repo contains the codebase for the mobile API. I will be building the backend with **C# and ASP.NET**. Because why not. I love the concept of DI and Dotnet is just so beautiful, I could use Typescript with Express or NestJS but I honestly don't feel like. I haven't written C# in a while, I miss my baby lol. Wetin I dey do. I will also be playing with .NET 9 and **Scalar** as my API docs tool instead of **Swagger** if you're a Dotnet dev, you will know why lol. Well, .NET 9 doesn't come with Swagger, Microsoft removed it due to a lack of maintenance. C# and React-Native somebody wake me up, that's a stack I never thought I will use lol.

I recorded how I built this project. Check it here. 


## Resources 

Okay, this is my first time working with .NET 9 since it was released. I felt frustrated at some point and wanted to use .NET 8 since I was comfortable with that. 
I was able to solve the issue I was facing and yeah, I tried stuffs I haven't tried before in this repo.

1. **Working with Scalar**: A Swagger alternative, with modern look and feel, fantastic tool. Since Microsoft removed Swashbuckle (Swagger API Explorer) from .NET9, Scalar has been the go-to API Explorer tool in the .NET community. Scalar is really awesome, I am rooting for the team behind it. I might try their express package when next I write Express or NestJS. You should totally check them out. https://github.com/scalar/scalar Drop a star on their repos too. Top stuff.
2. **Implementing a Decorator Pattern**: Although I've known this design pattern since November 2024 when I started taking my C# / Design patterns and architectural patterns seriously. All thanks to Milan JovanoviÄ‡. That man has changed the way I write code and approach problems. He is a Full-time .NET gospel preacher. He lives and breathes .NET, 2x Microsoft MVP (3x this year). He shares rare gems on his blog and YouTube channel. You should check him out. https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/ I always have a active tab of Milan's blog on my browser. He is too good.


Well I also learned other things but the above stood out. This is a very simple project (mobile and API lol). I built this just to get my feet wet in the world of Mobile development / Backend APIs too. The world isn't ready for me yet. The goal is to be a world-class Fullstack (web + mobile, backend + cloud and infra) Engineer.
