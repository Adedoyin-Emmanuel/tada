# Mobile App üéñÔ∏è

This repo contains the mobile app codebase. This is my first time bulding an app with **React-Native** and the experience is mind blowing. I was able to learn the basics in just 3 days and then I started bulding an app based on a figma design I saw on [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/proto/KO7dwifUAa8Byw2TMxQLcj?node-id=0-1&t=vNICL0r7b8DPznqe-6).

And then to upgrade my C# knowledge, I will be bulding the backend in C# and ASP.NET Core. I should be done in 2 weeks or even this week lol.
